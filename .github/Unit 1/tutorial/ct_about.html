        <p><strong>Curbside Thai</strong> brings the rich flavor of Thailand to
           North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35
           years of experience at the house of Asia, now offers
           that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte
           with our modern mobile food truck.</p>

            paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various
            mobile locations throughout downtown Charroltte from
            11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and

            difference! If you can't get away from your desk,
            <em>Curbside Thai will deliver.</em></p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The culinary art of the food truck vendor has been steadily
                    improving over the last 10 years with fine offerings from
                    Antonio's Italian, Organic on the Road, and now Curbside Thai.
                    Sajja Adulet is to be congratulated for offering delicious
                    and authentic Thai food at a reasonable price. We think
                    Curbside Thai provides the finest Asian food on or off
                    the streets of Charlotte.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Steaming rice with a spicy Asian sauce is commen street fare
                and we all accept its limitations in exchange for the
                convenience of a quick bite on the run. With Curbside Thai you
                don't have to compromise. Building on his experience as a
                master chef at several fine establishments on the East Coast,
                Sajja Adulet has brought the taste of fine dining to the
                Food Cart Wars and we couldn't be happier.</p>
